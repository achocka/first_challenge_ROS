# Welcome to achocka's First ROS Challenge!

Hi! I'm a Final-Year Electrical Engineering Student, and an aspiring firmware/software Engineer. This is my foray into ROS (although I've had experience with C++ and a lil bit of python).


# First Challenge

This program uses the pub/sub model in ROS to sum two different integers. The first process prompts the user to enter a number. The second process subscribes to this message, and prompts the user to enter a second number. The first process subcribes to the message from process 2, and sums the two numbers. NOTE: These numbers have to be in between 1 and 1000.

# Build
- ROS is required
- This repo can be cloned, and tested. (using roscore)
- -sample output image is provided
